<h1>No results found</h1>
<p>No results were found for the search query. To find the information you want,
try one of the following strategies:</p>
<ul>
  <li>If you used more than one search term, try typing OR between each term. By
    default, the search engine treats the terms as though there were an AND
    between them, and only returns results that contain all the terms.</li>
  <li>Consider alternative phrases, words, or spellings for the information.</li>
  <li>Check to ensure that you are not needlessly limiting the search; click <b>Advanced</b>
    to see the advanced search options. Clear all three check boxes to remove
    any filtering, and try the search again.</li>
</ul>
