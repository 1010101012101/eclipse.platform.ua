Provides support for listeners that are notified of cheat sheet events.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package specifies the API for cheat sheet listeners.  Classes that implement the ICheatSheetItemListener and 
ICheatSheetViewListener interfaces can be notified of cheat sheet item and view events as they occur.  Sample view events 
that are fired to these listeners include view opening and closing events, and sample item events are item skipped and item completion events.
Classes that implement at least one of these interfaces must be registered using the cheatsheetContent extension point 
with a listener tag in the Client's plugin.xml file.  Listeners used will be notified of events from the cheat sheets view as 
they occur, and can access the ICheatSheetManager implementation from the event received.  Events are received
by these listeners in the form of an implementation of ICheatSheetItemEvent or ICheatSheetViewEvent.  
These event objects will contain information about the event and provide a handle to the implementation of ICheatSheetManager 
for the cheat sheet..
<p>
Here is a sample snippet from a plugin.xml file that registers the com.org.xyz.ItemListener class that implements 
ICheatSheetItemListener to listen for item events from the cheat sheet with the id com.org.xyz.cheatsheet.
The com.org.xyz.ItemListener class resides in the plugin with id com.org.xyz.plugin.

Clients writing plug-ins that want to be notified of cheat sheet item and view events to integrate their code with their cheat sheets will be interested in the types provided by this package.
Useful api's for tracking user progress through cheat sheets and view open and closing events.
