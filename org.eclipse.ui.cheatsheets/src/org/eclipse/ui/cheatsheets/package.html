Provides support for plug-ins to dynamically change cheat sheet content and track cheat sheet data, also provides actions to launch the cheat sheets view.
<h2>
Package Specification</h2>
This package specifies the API related to modifying and manipulating the contents of a cheat sheet.  
This includes adding and removing sub items from a cheat sheet, changing actions launched by an item or sub item,
delayed setting the action to be run by an item or a sub item, changing the buttons available to a user
for an item or sub item in the cheat sheet, and so on.  
<p>This package has several useful interfaces such as ICheatSheetManager,
which allows the storage and retrieval of information related to a particular cheat sheet.  
Each cheat sheet that is opened has an implementation of ICheatSheetManager that manages data associated 
with the cheat sheet.  Data may be stored and retrieved from the implementation of ICheatSheetManager, and 
any data stored in it is persisted for the cheat sheet until it is either completed or restarted.  Using the ICheatSheetManager
you can modify step information for a cheat sheet on the fly.  Furthermore, you can add and remove sub steps for a cheat sheet
step.
</p><p> You can get a handle to the ICheatSheetManager either by using actions for your cheat sheet steps that implement
ICheatSheetAction interface, or by registering listeners using ICheatSheetItemListener or ICheatSheetViewListener interfaces.
Actions that implement ICheatSheetAction get a handle to the ICheatSheetManager when the action is run.
The listeners that are registered using the cheatsheetContent extension point with a listener tag receive a handle to the 
implementaion of the ICheatSheetManager for the active cheat sheet from the event objects it receives.
</p>
<p>There are two action classes available 
in this package that may be helpful for launching the cheat sheets view.  One to launch the view using a regular action,
and one to launch the cheat sheets view from the help contents.
</p>
<p>
Clients writing plug-ins that integrate cheat sheet steps with their plugin code will be interested in the types provided by this package.
